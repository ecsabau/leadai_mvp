A Python-based system that analyzes lead data from CSV files and generates professional PDF reports with contact details, budgets, and interest categories.

## ‚ú® Features
- **CSV Processing**: Reads lead data (name, email, budget, interest)
- **PDF Reports**: Generates formatted, multi-column reports
- **Unicode Support**: Handles special characters (√©, Ê±â, etc.)
- **Customizable**: Easily adapt columns or scoring logic

## üöÄ Quick Start
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ecsabau/leadai_mvp.git
   
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Generate the report:
   ```bash
   python report.py

üìÇ File Structure:
```leadai_mvp/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ report.py               # Main PDF generation script
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sample_leads.csv        # Example dataset (fake data)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt        # Python dependencies
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore             # Specifies files to exclude from Git
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ leadai_report.pdf       # Sample output (generated)
```
üöÄ Usage
1. Prepare Your Data:
Create a CSV file named leads.csv with these columns (or modify report.py to match your schema):
```
csv
name,email,phone,budget,interest,pages_visited,time_spent_sec
John Doe,john@example.com,555-1234,$10K,Real Estate,"['/funds','/pricing']",227
```
2. Generate Reports:
```bash
python report.py
Output will be saved as leadai_report.pdf

üß© Customization
```
1. Modify Report Columns

Edit these lines in report.py:
```
headers = ["Name", "Email", "Budget", "Interest"]  # Change column titles
col_widths = [40, 80, 30, 40]                    # Adjust column widths
```

2. Add Scoring Logic

Insert before PDF generation:
```
# Example: Score based on time spent
df["score"] = df["time_spent_sec"] / 10
```

üõ°Ô∏è Data Security
For sensitive data:

1. Add to .gitignore:
  ```bash
   echo "leads.csv" >> .gitignore
  ```
2. Use environment variables for paths:
   ```
   import os
   csv_path = os.getenv('LEADS_CSV_PATH', 'sample_leads.csv')
   ```
